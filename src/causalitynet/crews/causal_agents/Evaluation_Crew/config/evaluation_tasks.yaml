    Evaluate the fact-checking output for accuracy and credibility.
    The evaluation agent should analyze the output from the fact-checking crew to determine its quality.
    Evaluate the causal tagging output for completeness and correctness.
    The evaluation agent should assess whether the causal relationships have been properly identified and tagged.
    Combine evaluations of fact checking and causal tagging to determine the overall quality.
    The evaluation agent should aggregate the scores and messages from both evaluations to produce a comprehensive assessment.
    If cause effect tagging is not present, the evaluation agent should tag them by itself. You are an advanced AI model and can do that.
    Use this prompt only if the tagging is not present:
    "You are an advanced language model tasked with identifying and tagging explicit cause-and-effect relationships in complex sentences.
    Do not modify the original text when adding tags.
    IMPORTANT: Do not provide any output unless all three tags—cause, trigger, and effect—are present in the sentence. If any tag is missing, output "NoTag" and set the label to 0.
    
    Steps:
    1. Causality Determination:
       - Analyze the input sentence to determine if it contains an explicit causal relationship.
       - If the sentence is not causal, output "NoTag" and set the label to 0 without tagging.
       - If the sentence is causal, proceed only if all three elements (cause, trigger, and effect) are present.
       - If any element is missing, output "NoTag" and set the label to 0.
    2. Tagging Instructions:
       - Tag the sentence by enclosing the cause with <cause>...</cause>, the trigger with <trigger>...</trigger>, and the effect with <effect>...</effect>.
       - The cause represents the event or condition leading to an outcome.
       - The trigger is the word or phrase indicating causality (for example, because or due to).
       - The effect is the outcome or result of the cause.
    3. Causality Tests:
       - Ensure that the effect clearly answers "Why?" by directly resulting from the cause.
       - Confirm that the cause precedes the effect in time.
       - Verify that the effect does not occur in the absence of the cause.
       - Check that the cause and effect cannot be interchanged without altering the meaning.
       - The sentence should be rephraseable as "X causes Y" or "Due to X, Y."
    4. Additional Guidelines:
       - The sentence must explicitly state a cause-effect relationship.
       - If there are multiple causes or effects, tag each instance separately.
       - Do not alter the original sentence structure when adding tags.
       - The final output must include all three tags: <cause>, <trigger>, and <effect>.
       - If no explicit causal relationship is found, output "NoTag."
    5. Output Format:
       - Return a JSON object with two keys: "tagged" and "label".
       - "tagged" should contain the original sentence with all tags added.
       - "label" should be set to 1 if a causal relationship is successfully tagged; otherwise, set to 0.
       
    Examples:
    - For a sentence with a clear causal relationship and all tags present, the output should show the tagged sentence and a label of 1.
    - For a sentence without a clear causal relationship, the output should be "NoTag" with a label of 0.
    
    Additionally, include examples from the retriever agent when applicable.
    
    QA:
    - For sentences that are tagged as causal, include a brief explanation of the cause-and-effect relationship.
    
    Final Instruction:
    Process the following input text: {headline} and only output JSON which is said in step 5. Do not output anything else.
    Note: Reconsider your decisions step by step internally (chain-of-thought) but do not output your reasoning.
    IMPORTANT: Do not provide any output unless all three tags (cause, trigger, and effect) are present."  
    Do not waste too much time thinking about the overall evaluation.
  expected_output: >
    There are 3 things needed:
    1. A JSON object containing a quality score and a status message regarding the accuracy and credibility of the fact-checking output.
    2. A JSON object containing a quality score and a status message regarding the completeness and correctness of the causal tagging output.
    3. A JSON object summarizing the evaluation with scores and status messages for each component, providing an overall quality assessment.
